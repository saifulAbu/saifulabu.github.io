## Ernesto's visit to prison

Ernesto is a mexican guy living in united states on visa. his mexican girlfriend has been staying with him for sometime. today ernesto felt that he is done with her girl friend. So he asked to pack her stuffs and leave his place. He felt for a quite a bit of time that the relationship is not working and he would rather be on her own than to be around someone who is abusive as she was. So her girlfriend packs her bags and puts everything outside of the door. He could see her talking someone on phone from his balcony. She is probably calling a taxi or some of her family members he thought. A few minutes later he heard some kind of ambulance sirens outside his apartment. He did not suspect anything. Next he heard a knock his door. He opened the door and saw two big police officer standing out of his door. 
 Police officer- what's going?
 ernesto - Nothing.
 PO - Whose belongings are these?
 e - My ex girlfriend's
 PO - how did these things got outside?
 e - she moved herself
 PO - please turn around and face the wall. (ernesto obeys their command). You are under arrest for bodily injuring your ex-girlfriend.(the officer puts handcuff on ernesto)
 
 ernesto was really surprised. As he was taken to the police car, he looked at her ex-girlfriend. she was crying and was telling something to the guys on the ambulance. Probably explaining how smith beat her up. Such a liar, smith thought. 
 
Once he got into the car, he asked the cops, is it that simple to arrest someone. anyone can call cops on someone, will they get arrested. how do they know that she is actually telling the truth. the cops said mr. ernesto when we asked you what's going on, you told us nothing was going on. later you said you had a fight with your ex. now tell us who is telling the lie. smith did not say anything. he chose to keep his silence. 

officer - you can make phone calls once we reach the police station.
ernesto - i am sure some of my friends will take steps to get me out
officer - don't go back to your house today. if you get second call on you on the same night, it will be a felony. we will advice you to stay some other place

he thought he would make a phone call from his phone once he reaches the police station. his friends would take steps to free him out.

as he went to the police station, he saw probably a middle eastern person. that person seemed to be kind. 

middle eastern guy - did you really hurt the girl.
ernesto - no i did not
guy - i believe you. is she from here or from other foreign country?
ernesto - she's not from here.
guy - anyway, do you have 1000$ with you by any chance? 
ernesto - no i don't have 1000$ with me at this moment
guy - okay now you have to return your phone and we will turn it off. go ahead and write down 3 phone numbers that you want to call.
ernesto copied 3 phone numbers. the middle eastern guy showed him a telephone booth in the police station. the also gave him special one time dress and pair of sandals to smith. the dress and sandals are both made of almost the same material. some african-american guy was on the phone try to reach someone. he seemed to be not able to reach the desired person.

at last ernesto got hold of the phone. he tried reaching a frined after another. the phone on the police station was different. everytime you call someone, they have 30 second prompt.then it rings. strangely, no friend of his receive the call.

he waited for sometime. the middle eastern guy called him to get a photograph. earnesto was worried. he is an immigrant, an event such as an arrest can be devastating for him. at the same time, he wanted to have a different perspective. he wanted to enjoy what is happening. he knew not many people will have an experience of dealing with an arrest. he tried many several times the 3 numbers he had. he could not reach anyone. the middle eastern guy said it's okay, you will be taken to the detention center, they have a phone there. you can call your friends from there. 

a few minutes later cops took earnesto and an african-american guy to a large prison van. it was pretty big. earnesto was feeling ill whole day, he probably had fever. and now all these. as they started the journey to the detention center far away, earnesto felt the road was taking for ever to finish. he asked the african american guy how far is the detention center. the guy replied it would be about 20 miles. earnesto started feeling motion sick after 20 minutes. he started throwing up. it was probably anxiety, it was probably he was just sick. the african american guy started screaming, hey officer, the boy is sick, he is throwing up.

everything ends at some time. so did the journey to the detention center. the police prison van entered in something that looked like a large garage. a large door opened and the prison van got inside. earnesto saw many officers, male female working pretty busy there. he got out of the van. a lady officer came to him. she saw he was vomiting. she seemed to be a kind person. she said may be it's anxiety. earnesto let her know that he had fever and he is not feeling well. the lady took her in. got her weight and height. asked a few questions to determine if he has any psychological problem. after all this procedures is done, an officer escorted him and the african guy to another place where there were a lot of people sitting.

as earnesto got into the room, the girls started giggling. "what is this thing doing here?", they said. there was one woman who also got arrested. she seemed to be really nice. most of the people seemed pretty relaxed in the entrance. earnesto was talking to that lady. she said you have very white teeth. earnesto had a dentist appointment a few days back. he saw some people are trying to talk on a phone that was hanging on the wall.
